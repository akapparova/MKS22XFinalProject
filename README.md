# World of Gui
## Group: Kappleetely Broken (Vivien Lee, Asim Kapparova, MKS22X Period 6)



### Game Summary/Objective (Taken from the World of Goo Wikipedia Page!):
  The game is built around the idea of creating large structures using balls of goo. The main objective of the game is to get a requisite number of goo balls to a pipe designed to represent the exit. In order to do so, the player must use the goo balls to construct bridges, towers, and other structures to overcome gravity and various terrain difficulties such as chasms, hills, spikes, windmills, or cliffs. There are several types of goo balls in the game, each of which has unique properties. The player must exploit combinations of these goo balls in order to complete each level.
